Specification of Problem and goal
	Need to specify enough to talk concretely about what I have produced in the next slide(s)
Specification of final result (treating presentation as having knowledge of the whole process)
Design and Implementation
	- General Coding patterns (define as needed, modularity, separation of Simulation and the rest, UI)
	- Separation of Simulation behaviour and data, focus on data modules over entities
	- Tick based framework of the Simulation, running history (demo?)
	- Displaying the Simulation Visually (Description of basic culling and drawing systems)
	- How the Simulation informs gameplay
		- Simulation Generated gameplay patterns (Attacking Settlements, Mineral Deposits)
		- Pacing of player gameplay into sections through locations (Comparison to loading screens, problems with this)
	- Player gameplay that is more separated from the Simulation (Progression, items, etc.)
Additional Points (catch all)
